# Beyond Carbon

Forests are a critical piece of our climate change mitigation strategy and we depend on satellites and sensors to measure a forest's potential to sequester carbon. What this valuation completely misses is people - communities who've stewarded these landscapes for centuries with their labor, wisdom, songs, and stories. 

Beyond Carbon: Using Multisensory Data for Climate Action counters carbon-focused forest data with experiments in eco-acoustic, oral, and text formats that  foreground community-owned knowledges of landscapes against the dominant architecture of remote sensing infrastructures.
